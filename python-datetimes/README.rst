Python Datetime Conversions
===========================

`Blog Post`_

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: console

    $ python2 test.py
    $ python3 test.py

Both should work with no assertions and will output a conversion table in
markdown.

Note that these tests are only for *direct* conversion methods -- it is fully
possible (and sometimes necessary) to convert through intermediate states.

If I've missed any such methods, pull requests are gladly accepted.
